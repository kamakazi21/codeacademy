-A function is a sequence of instructions that performs a specifc task packed as a unit.
-Inputs to function are called parameters.
-When we call a function, the value we specify the instructions, inputs and name of the function.
-Control flow- set a instructions executed in a certain order.
-Control Structures can be used to alter control flow.
-Conditional control structures execute a computer instruction depending on the conditions.
-A loop is a sequence of instructions which is specfied once but which may be carried out several times in a row.
-In exception handling, two sets of instructions are defined. The first set is executed, and if an exception occurs the 
first set is stopped and the second set is executed.
-Data structures are formats that we can use to keep track of our data in an organized fashion.
-List acts as a container to store multiple pieces of information that  relae to each other in some way.
-When we add things to the end of a list we say that we are appending them to the end.
-A loop is a structure in programming where the instructions are written once, but a computer can execute them multiple times.
-Each execution of those instruction is called an iteration.
-For loops (count controlled loops) repeat for a specified number of times.
-While loops (condition controlled loops) repeat until condiiton changes.
-For each loops (collection controlled loops) repeat for each items in a collection.

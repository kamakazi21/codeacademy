- Document Type Declaration - lets web browsers know that you are using HTML. Must be first line of code in HTML <!DOCTYPE html>
- Save file with .html extension
- To create HTML structure, we must add opening adn ending <html> tags after <! DOCTYPE html>. Anything inside is code can be
  interpreted as html code
- <head> element goes above <body> element and contains metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that
  isnt displayed directly on the web page.
- <title> - tag always inside head
- <a> anchor element tag is used to link website
- href attribute inside <a> tag to refer to website
- target attribute specifies where sites should open
- target = _blank open in new window
- When making multipage static websites web developers often store HTML files in the root directory, or a main folder
  where all the files for the project are stored. If all files are stored in the same folder, we can link webpages together using 
  relative path.
- A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file (a file on the same website such as ./index.html)
- HTML allows you to turn every element into a link by wrapping the element with an anchor element.
- In order to link a target on the same page, we must give the target an id. An id can be added to most elements of a webpage
- <a id = "top"> </a> this is the top of the page
- <a href = "#top"> Top <a>
- Comments beginning with <!-- and end with --> are ignored by browser.

The <table> element will contain all of the tabular data you plan on displaying.
The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element: <tr>.
Each cell element must also be defined. In HTML, you can add data using the table data element. 
<td>-creates cells, must be inside <tr>.
To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: <th>.
The table heading element is used just like a table data element, except with a relevant title.
Just like table data, a table heading must be placed within a table row.
Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values.
row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.
Format - <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
We use CSS to add style to HTML
Data can span columns using the colspan attribute. 
The attributes accepts an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number of columns it spans across.
colspan attribute - <td colspan="2">
The rowspan attribute is used for data that spans multiple rows. 
It accepts an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number of rows it spans across.

Long tables can be sectioned off using the table body element: <tbody>.
